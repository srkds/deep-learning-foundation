This is the smallest toy example of neural network fitting squiggle to data and finding optimal values for its parameters. In real world there will be large no of data points and squiggle will be very complex and there will be large no of parameters to be learned.

## Multiple input and output(class) Neural Networks

Neural network tries to fit squiggle to all class of the dataset. Here three class and it's squiggle fit by NN is shown.
